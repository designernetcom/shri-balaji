                                    <p>Open schooling, as its name suggests, is open and welcomes all individuals
                                        seeking to begin their educational journey. This modern educational concept has
                                        redefined the way people approach learning, delivering a flexible and inclusive
                                        method of education. It differs from the traditional schooling conducted within
                                        the four walls of a physical school building with fixed schedules and structured
                                        curriculum.</p>

                                    <p>The concept of open schooling traces its root back to the mid-20th century in
                                        response to the limitations of traditional educational systems. Traditional
                                        education models often left certain segments of the population, such as working
                                        adults, differently-abled individuals, and those living in remote areas, without
                                        adequate learning opportunities.</p>

                                    <p>This lack of access to education was especially in developing countries, where
                                        economic, social, and geographic barriers blocked educational opportunities. The
                                        need for open schooling became increasingly evident in a world undergoing rapid
                                        transformation. To keep pace with these changes, governments took the initiative
                                        to introduce open schools. Their goal was to bridge this educational gap and
                                        ensure that learning remained accessible to a more diverse range of learners
                                        providing access to quality education for all.</p>

                                    <p>In line with the initiative to make quality education accessible to all, the
                                        National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) was established by the
                                        Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) in India in 1989. NIOS functions
                                        as an independent open school board, conducting secondary (10th) and senior
                                        secondary (12th) examinations that are on par with those by the CBSE and ICSE
                                        boards. It employs a student-centered approach through open and distance
                                        education, offering learners the flexibility to choose subjects according to
                                        their needs and study at their preferred pace.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) leads the effort to make open
                                        schooling an alternative to regular education, aiming to expand opportunities
                                        for disadvantaged and marginalized groups.</p>

                                    <p>In this mode, it enables students to learn at their own pace and focus on their
                                        specific interests, strengths, and weaknesses. Open schooling promotes
                                        accessibility to education, particularly for individuals who face geographical
                                        barriers, physical disabilities, or with busy life schedules. It promotes
                                        diverse learning styles and caters to student’s unique needs.</p>

                                    <p>To efficiently oversee the open schooling system, governments set up boards
                                        called open boards. These boards are managed by either the central or state
                                        government. Creating these open boards ensured that the quality of education in
                                        open schooling matched that of traditional institutions, by also providing
                                        primary, secondary, senior secondary, vocational, and skill education to diverse
                                        groups of students, with a strong focus on 10th and 12th.</p>

                                            The Telangana Open School Society (TOSS) was established as an autonomous
                                            society under the Andhra Pradesh Public Societies Act on February 20, 1991.
                                            TOSS is committed to extending educational opportunities to a diverse array
                                            of learners, guided by the motto of 'reach out and reach all.' It sticks to
                                            the principle of providing learners with the freedom to choose what and when
                                            they wish to learn.
